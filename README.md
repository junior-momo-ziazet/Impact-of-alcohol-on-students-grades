## Malicious android application detection with machine learning

## Abstract
In the past decade, Android rose up to be the most used Mobile Operating System with an .[87% market share]. (https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os#:~:text=Android%3A%20Android's%20smartphone%20share%20will,response%20despite%20the%20pandemic%20hurdles). Compared to its main competitor iOS, Android is a lax system that allows downloads from a wide variety of sources. The openness of Android allows the user to install software from unsupervised third-party stores, and it causes the system to be vulnerable to the injection of malicious software that could cause security breach as well as data privacy endangerment. This project aims at analysing the APK (Android Application Package Kit) files of Android applications in order to extract important signatures for the detection of malicious applications. Feature extraction techniques will be applied on the APK file and once the best attributes are determined, we will use them to develop a malware scanner. This work uses the .[Drebin].(https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/) dataset containing 5560 APKs of malicious applications combined with .[AndroZoo].(https://androzoo.uni.lu/) dataset also containing 6000 APKs of benign applications.
