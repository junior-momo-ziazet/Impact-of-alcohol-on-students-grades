# Impact-of-alcohol-on-students-grades
High levels of alcohol consumption among students are well documented. This is a concern because heavy alcohol consumption is not only harmful to health, but may also create social problems on the school environments and significant impact on student's performance. The aim of this study is to carry out an exploratory analysis of data on the alcohol consumption, and the environment of the secondary school students in order to build a predictive model to predict the final grade of students.The [used data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption) was obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students (about 33 features and 382 observations). We can start by examining the correlation between features and then use important features with Random forest, SVM or MLP to predict the final exam scores/grades based on students' alcohol consumption and other important features. we will evaluate the performance of our models using F1-score and precision.
